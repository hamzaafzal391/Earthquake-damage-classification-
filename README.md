This project was developed as part of my coursework at WorldQuant University. It focuses on predicting the extent of building damage after an earthquake using structured data. The main objective is to classify buildings based on the severity of damage sustained.

ðŸ“Œ Key Highlights:
Data Wrangling using SQL: Performed comprehensive data cleaning and preprocessing by writing SQL queries with JOIN, SELECT, and filtering operations to extract relevant features from a SQLite database.

End-to-End Pipeline: Implemented the full pipeline including data extraction, feature selection, and classification modeling.

Classification Task: The model aims to classify buildings into damage categories such as low, medium, or high.

Environment: The code is written in Python and is designed to be executed within a Jupyter Notebook environment.

Database Requirement: A connection to a SQLite database is required to run this notebook successfully.

Reference Output: Final model outputs, including classification reports and visualizations, are attached for reference.
